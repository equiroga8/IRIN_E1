# Phagocytosis Simulation
Phagocytes are cells present in blood and other tissues capable of capturing microorganisms and cellular remains (in general, all kinds of particles that are useless or harmful to the organism) and introducing them into the body in order to eliminate them, in a process known as phagocytosis. This is the inspiration for our project, the robot will do the function of phagocyte "eating" malignant bacteria. The phagocyte will leave the residue in the nearest artery and go for the oxygen molecules to the nearest vein.

The project consists of two parts, the first implements an architecture based on behavior using both subsumption and motor schema. In the second part this architecture is extended to a hybrid based on map resolution using the A* algorithm.
